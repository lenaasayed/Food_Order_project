Regular expression in mongodb:
filter {first_name: /^c/i}->find the first_name that start with letter c and ignore case sensitive by adding "i"
filter {first_name: /^c/i , age:{$gte:40}}-> find the age that grater than 40 also ^^
sort {age:1} -> sort by age 1 for ascending , -1 for descending
project {first_name:1,last_name:0}-> that mean include the first_name and execlude the last_name in the result
project {first_name:1,id:0}->id will be execluded but other wise it will included with the first_name

To use mongodb in vscode:
-open the powershell
-type mongo then enter to go to the mongo shell
then to use the database which you created
>show dbs 
>use "the name of your database"
>show collections
>db."name of speciific collections".count(),.find({filter},{project})
>.find().pretty()--> to show like a JSON , but this will give only the first 20 elements 
>.find().toArray()-->to show all elements like a JSON
>db.demo.find({age:{$gte:40}},{first_name:1,last_name:0}).limit(2).toArray() --> limit() must be before toArray()
>db.demo.insertOne({})
>db.demo.insertMany([{},{},{}])
>db.demo.deleteOne({}) --> it will delete the first record
>db.demo.deleteMany({age:56})
>to add a collection >db.demo1.insertOne({})
